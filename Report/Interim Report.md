1. Since starting this project, we have made significant progress in developing our housing price prediction system for subregions. First, we established a step-by-step workflow covering data preparation, model building, and training setup. We collected and cleaned the Beijing dataset (2012-2018) by fixing data formats, removing empty entries and unusual values, then created time-based subregion matrices stored as NPZ files for easier processing. For the model development, we built three key parts: a data loader that organizes information in batches, a neural network with four parallel analysis branches connected through a fusion module, and an automated training system that tracks progress using RMSE scores to measure prediction accuracy. While these core components are now working together, we recognize the current dataset is limited to Beijing and plan to expand it next. Our current results provide a solid base for further model improvements and more comprehensive testing with additional data sources.
2. We currently face three main challenges in our research. First, our Beijing dataset (2012-2018) contains limited historical data, which may not be sufficient for accurate predictions, so we plan to incorporate additional datasets. Second, we're encountering difficulties processing the New York dataset - specifically, mapping addresses to specific areas (subregions) has proven challenging due to the complex nature of handling 740,000 unique addresses. Third, we're still refining how to best model future price expectations, particularly in aligning our time-based predictions with established economic theories about housing market trends. To address these issues, our next steps will focus on expanding our data sources, improving our address conversion system for large datasets, and strengthening the economic theory foundation of our prediction models.
3. In the next phase of our research, we will focus on three main improvements to enhance our housing price prediction model. First, we plan to refine the model's structure, particularly improving how it predicts future price trends by better incorporating economic theories and analyzing how prices change over time. Second, we aim to enrich the model’s spatial analysis by testing grid-based satellite imagery—comparing area-wide price predictions with individual house price estimates based on satellite data features—to see if this helps predict single-home prices more accurately.                                                                                At the same time, we will run three key experiments: 1) comparing our model’s performance against basic methods like Lasso regression to measure improvements, 2) solving the New York dataset issues by building tools to automatically convert addresses into subregions (especially challenging with 740,000 unique addresses), and 3) testing our system with combined data from multiple cities. These steps will help us fix current limitations while ensuring our approach works reliably across different types of data.
